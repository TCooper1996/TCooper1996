- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TCooper1996
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing with any distributed programming language, especially within the domain of object-oriented and functional programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity game engine to practice working with large software projects.
I have experience with many langauges, including c/c++, Java, Javascript, Typescript, and Clojure, and my favorites are Python, C# and Haskell.
I'm also familiar front-end frameworks such as Django and React.
